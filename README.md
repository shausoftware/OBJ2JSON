# OBJ2JSON
A small Java tool I hacked together so that I could easily transform Wavefront .OBJ models into JSON for use with WebGL. It takes OBJ Model files and pre-processes them by breaking up the model according to material assignment. An example is provided demonstrating it's usage. It's not pretty but I found it useful.

main run method is in ObjProcessor
